SJSU CMPE 244 (Embedded Software) Project

Space Impact - Game using FreeRTOS

Introduction: Space Impact is a classic game from the days of the Nokia era. Our objective was to design a game in which a player is prompted to protect a spaceship from incoming missiles by moving the ship up and down. The player would also have the ability to fire back at the incoming enemies. The enemy ship's movements would speed up as the game progresses, increasing the difficulty of the game.
