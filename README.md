Space Impact - Game using FreeRTOS

Introduction: Space Impact is a classic game from the days of the Nokia era. Our objective was to design a game in which a player is prompted to protect a spaceship from incoming missiles by moving the ship up and down. The player would also have the ability to fire back at the incoming enemies. Taking damage from the enemy will reduce the health of the spaceship and zero health will lead to the game over screen.
