Space Impact - Game using FreeRTOS

Introduction: Space Impact is a classic game from the days of the Nokia era. Our objective was to design a game in which a player is prompted to protect a spaceship from incoming missiles by moving the ship up and down. The player would also have the ability to fire back at the incoming enemies. Taking damage from the enemy will reduce the health of the spaceship and zero health will lead to the game over screen.  The game involves a user controlling a spaceship through an accelerometer, guiding the spaceship across many enemy spacecraft and obstacles. These obstacles are generated randomly and appear from the right-hand side of the screen. The player shoots the obstacles with bullets by pressing a button clearing a path for him or herself. The game starts on the press of the button and ends when the players runs out of health by taking too many hits. The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible acquiring as many points as he or she can.
